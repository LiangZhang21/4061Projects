1. Background
Network sockets, or simply “sockets”, enable processes to communicate
with each other. In many regards, sockets appear to process to be simply
another file, but a file that permits a process to pass data to another
process, usually on another machine. In some sense, sockets can be viewed
as being similar to pipes, except the two communicating processes may be on
different machines, connected by a network (such as the Internet). Like pipes,
 sockets have special operations for opening and closing a socket, and a few
 other operations. Typically, one process, the server, listens on a socket
 that has a particular IP address and port number. Another process, the
 client, uses its socket to establish a connection with the server’s socket.
In this programming assignment, you will extend the “word length statistics”
application covered in previous projects. There will be a server and
multiple clients. Mappers are implemented as client processes and reducers
as a single server process. Clients (mappers) read files, compute word length
statistics for the files, and send the data to the server. The server (reducer)
accumulates the word length statistics sent by clients. The server and clients
 will communicate via sockets-based TCP connections, rather than files or pipes.
