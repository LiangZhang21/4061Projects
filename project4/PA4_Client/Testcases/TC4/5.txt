2.3 The client program
The client program spawns multiple client processes
 (mapper processes) as shown in Figure 1. Each client
 process is assigned a unique client ID when it is spawned.
 The client ID starts from 1 and increments by 1. The processes
 run in parallel. Each client sends the following messages
 in that order from 1. UPDATE_WSTAT to 4. GET_WSTAT requests.

1.	0 or N UPDATE_WSTAT request(s) (If there is no file, do
not send this request. If you attempt extra credit, you need
to send this request multiple times to send word length
statistics for multiple files.)
2.	1 GET_MY_UPDATES request
3.	1 GET_ALL_UPDATES request
4.	1 GET_WSTAT request

Clients initiate a TCP connection with the server on given
IP address and port number for a single request and close the
TCP connection. A new TCP connection should be initiated and
terminated for each request. For extra credit, a TCP connection
is used to exchange all the requests between a client and a server
thread. Please refer to Section 5. Extra Credits if you attempt it.
