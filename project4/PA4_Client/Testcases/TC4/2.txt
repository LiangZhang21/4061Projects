2. Project Overview
In this programming assignment,
you will make two executables (two separate independent programs),
server and client. For server program, you will use multithreading
to implement a multi-threaded server. For client program, you will
generate multiple client processes. Each client process reads a file,
processes “word length statistics” and sends a message to the server
through TCP connections. The server spawns a thread whenever it establishes
a new TCP connection with a client. The statistics sent by clients are
accumulated in a shared resource named “Result Histogram”. You can
reuse your codes for computing word length statistics since the definition
of a word for this assignment is the same with the one used in previous projects.
Space and newline character are the only delimiters. For example,
here is an example sentence: Thi’s is. a te_xt* 0h gr8!!! The words in this
sentence are {Thi’s, is., a, te_xt*, 0h, gr8!!!} and the length of the words
are {5, 3, 1, 6, 2, 6}.
