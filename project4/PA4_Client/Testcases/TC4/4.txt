2.2 The server program
The server program is a multi-threaded server as shown in Figure 1.
The server is responsible for listening for incoming socket connection
requests and establishing connections with clients. The server waits for
connections on the specified port. When it receives a connection request,
it should spawn a new thread to handle that connection. The thread is
responsible for handling a request from a client by reading clientâ€™s message
from a socket set up between them, doing necessary computation
(refer to Section 3. Communication Protocol) and sending a response
to the client back through the socket. The thread should exit after it
processes a request and closes the client connection. For example, a
client sends to the server four different types of messages stated in
Section 2.1, and for different threads handle individual messages using
separate TCP connections between the client and server. For the extra credit,
a thread handles all the multiple requests from a client. Please refer to
Section 5. Extra Credits if you attempt it.
