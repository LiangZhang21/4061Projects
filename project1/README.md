# Project 1 : MapReduce - Word counts of different lengths

## Master function (mapreduce.c)

To be updated

## Map function (mapper.c)

To be updated

## Reduce function (reducer.c)

To be updated

## Compile
	> make clean
	> make

## Execution
	// always call make clean and make before you start execution
	// ./mapreduce nMappers nReducer inputFileDir
	> ./mapreduce 5 3 test/T0

## Result
Check output folder for all the results
	
## Note:
The current code is the first draft. There might be some edge case that I missed, like the empty file case. I am working on them. The code is just for giving you an idea of how the overall project looks like.

The header files are not required as the function definition is in the same file as usage. This is the layout that I usually follow.
